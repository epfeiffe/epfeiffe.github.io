            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;I have 2 younger brothers, Simon and Max, and a dog, Ahsoka. My parents are proud alumni of the University of Illinois and raised me in Saline Michigan. Growing up in the mitten state, I spent lots of time playing in the snow as a kid. I have learned to appreciate summer and nature more as a Michigander since summers are short and pitch perfect weather is limited. My grandparents, who live near New Buffalo Michigan, own property on Lake Michigan. My family spends time with them on holidays such as Independence Day and Labor Day. I recognize that relaxing on the beach while getting some alone time is a privilege. I think everyone should spend a little time alone in nature with their own thoughts. Personally, I need the mental reset when I feel stressed or exhausted.

              <h1>Career Focus</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;Experience in Boy Scouts evoked my interest in Environmental Engineering. However, changed my mind shortly after beginning college, focusing on the growing industry of Computer Science. Tinkering with computer games and toys as a kid inspired me to take this route, as I often find myself tinkering with code for personal, school, and work projects. I love to experiment with code and learn new ways of writing scripts. In my personal experience, micro managing members of a team doesn't always work well. Taking self-initiative on side projects for personal growth or freelancing is what I strive for, and deploying an entrepreneurial mindset to attack new problems inspires me. I love the process of learning and applying new concepts on my own.

            <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;As a teen, playing soccer and participating in pole vault for track and field were my standout sports. I played club soccer for six years and junior varsity soccer for two. At michigan, I play intramural soccer and basketball; the latter has become my new favorite sport. Rooting for Michigan basketball and football have become the norm at my time in Ann Arbor, as the Crisler Center(basketball arena) and the Big House(football stadium) provide electric atmospheres. Outside of sports,I enjoy hobbies such as learning new coding languages, writing scripts, and participating in the college organization <a href="http://www.sedsatum.org/" target="_blank">SEDS</a>.

            <h1>What I'm Great At</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;Through teaching my younger brothers how to play games, guiding young men in Boy Scouts, or assisting customers at Bert's Cafe, communicating and working with others is a trait I pride myself in. Staying open minded about new problems and the way others think has payed dividends when developing creative solutions in school and work. Any time I work on a project for myself or for others, my priority is to make it practical and robust. Starting new project ideas without completing them to my fullest capability is counterproductive in my mind. Wether it is mowing the neighbors lawn for a few bucks as a teenager or coding a website for a client, I prefer to complete the task to the best of my ability. Helping others grow and learn creates deep fulfillment for me.

            <h1>What I Wish I Was Better At</h1>
            <p>
                &emsp;In high school, I took the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">16personalities</a> test and got the Defender personality. My strengths and weaknesses were listed with surprising accuracy, allowing me to better understand what I need to work on as a person. Since I am more introverted, standing up for myself and my time has always been problematic for me, as some of my childhood friends accidentally abused this to get me to do things I didn't want to do. Knowing when to say no and being assertive is something I have improved on but continue to struggle with. In addition, staying true to myself and speaking what I honestly feel in group environments is a struggle, and not letting the opinions of others dictate my actions is challenging for me. I want to help as many people as I can, and often I sacrifice my wellbeing to do so. When disagreements occur, I usually take things too personally and allow my ego to disrupt my intentions. I believe this trait originated in my youth; as the eldest sibling, I always got my way with my brothers. I always got to choose the game we played or what friends we talked too because I was the oldest, whereas now I am on an even playing field and struggle to suppress my selfish motives. Hopefully by understanding the root of these issues I can continue to improve them.
