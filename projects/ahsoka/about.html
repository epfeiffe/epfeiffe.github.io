          <p>
            Ahsoka lived on the streets as a puppy and grew up in a harsh
            environment. The Pfeiffer family adopted her in 2010 when she was 1
            year old. Her original name was Wendy, and we though Mandy would be
            a good name instead. However, the three children in the Pfeiffer
            family were heavily invested in the TV show Star Wars The Clone Wars
            at the time, and decided Ahsoka, a female padawan in the show, would
            be a more unique and fun name. In the TV show, Ahsoka's lightsaber
            is green and her cloths feature lots of purple, and for that reason
            Ahsoka has a purple collar and green leash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the comedic naming and dress style, Ahsoka still acts like a
            street dog in many aspects. She engorges as much food as she can
            when presented the opportunity. She jumps on counters to steal food
            frequently, and she also likes to run away from her family to sniff
            exotic smells such as poop. Despite all of this, the Pfeiffers still
            love her and tend to her needs. One of her best qualities is that
            she is very defensive of the family, and will protect it at any
            cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her favorite activities are walking, running, sleeping, howling,
            cuddling, and eating. She especially loves her green treat ball, and
            when she rolls it around, treats fall out of it! One of Ahsoka's
            best friends, Bailey, is on the right. Bailey is a young, female
            lab. Ahsoka usually doesn't get along with other girls, but Bailey
            is young enough for her to be friendly.

              Below is a video of Bailey who is owned by the Tomecheks,
              ancestors of the Pfeiffers. Bailey is much younger and leans on
              Ahsoka's guidance during long walks.
