          Ahsoka (pronounced ahh-SO-ca) is a hound and beagle mix. She howls at
          anyone who approaches our house, but once she smells your shoes, she
          will love you!

          <h3>Part Beagle</h3>
          <p>
            Her large, flappy ears look like mini solar panels on her head. Add
            her cute face and ability to learn tricks like roll over, wait, and
            jump, and you have plenty of beagle characteristics.

          <h3>Part Hound</h3>
          <p>
            If you hear howling from the neighbor's house, it isn't a wolf! This
            dog loves to utilize her vocal cords when meeting new guests, but
            don't worry... it's only a precautionary measure done out of love
            for the family.

          <h3>All Fun</h3>
          <p>
            In her spare time, Ahsoka enjoys going on walks, chasing
            rodents(raccoons, squirrels, and chipmunks), and eating. Guided by
            feral instincts, she roams outdoors and defends the lawn from the
            evil people walking by.
