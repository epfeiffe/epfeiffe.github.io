                <p>
                    &emsp;At Uber, I worked on a QR code scanner to transfer authenticated user sessions across devices, built in React/Redux. For example, if a user is logged in on their phone and wishes to log in via desktop, they can simple scan the QR code, confirm on their phone, and log in on their computer. <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com">WhatsApp</a> has a similar implementation.

                    &emsp;Similar to the Google Chrome Extension Moment, I made a landing page in javascript. I added a list of my favorite quotes from people I look up to such as historical figures like Mahatma Gandhi, or current actors such as Jim Carrey. I did a little math in order to display a unique quote every day.

                    &emsp;In an attempt to work on my HTML and CSS skills, I figured making a website for my dog would help while showing off her cuteness to the world. Ahsoka is a hound beagle mix and is very protective of her family.

                    &emsp;Over spring break in my senior year of highschool, I traveled to Haiti with around twenty other seniors and two teachers. We stayed in a compound near Port Au Prince and installed water filters for the local community. It was a great experience to get away from our phones and live in the moment while learning about a different. The trip was in cooperation with the non-profit organization Poured Out.

                    &emsp;This is a pretty dated site where I showcase my Computer Aided Design skills in my AutoCAD Highschool class. I worked on free form models and dimensioning, among other views. I made a wind turbine and solar panel for the annual <a href="https://mites.cc/">MITES</a> competition.

                    &emsp;I took a Video Production class in Highschool, posting several videos to my old Vimeo account. Some of these are pretty goofy to look at in retrospect. My highlight piece is embedded above. My friend and I made a video on the risks of premature drinking and entered it in the <a href="https://courageouspersuaders.com/">Courageous Persuaders</a> competition where we won third place.
